## Project Description

### Music sharing

Are you tired of listening to radios and billboards over and over again? You'd either have to put up with a lot of songs that are noises to your ears, or listen to your favorite songs over and over again until you get annoyed of it. Then you think you've had enough, so you go and spend a lot of time hunting for new songs to give your playlist a new look. This could be really an annoying experience.

But don't worry! Our MusiCloud is the perfect solution to your dilemma. At MusiCloud, you can share songs with your friends, and like and comment on your friends' posted musics. What's more, you can even share playlists of songs, which shows your friends your music collections and your music tastes. Therefore, you can simply listen to your friends' playlists with similar music tastes when you want to listen to some music while you're working or studying, without having to live with your old playlists that you have listened to a million times, or take the trouble to discover new good songs.

Moreover, if you do not have many friends, MusiCloud still have a handful for you. We have this feature called "What's hot", which shows you the trending hashtags of all the musics that our users post, and you can click into those hashtags to see all the trending musics. Agnd for example, if you like Jazz, you can click into the tag "Jazz" and find all Jazz music.

### Audio sharing

Some of you have talents in singing or playing instruments. You might want to show your talents to your friends, but all you can do is to take the pains to set up your phone or laptop to record a video of you and upload it to Instagram or Facebook. This is troublesome. But with MusiCloud, you can simply record your voice with your phone or any device and upload this piece of audio to our website to share it with your friends. Or, you might also record a piece of live music at a concert or show and share it on MusiCloud.

Also at times you might want to express how you feel at the moment. Many people type it out and tweet it, but many others remain silent and do not bother to do it. With MusiCloud, they can simply record a piece of voice memo with their phones and share it on our website. This is much like a audio version of Twitter.
